        <h1>Hello to our wonderful API</h1>
        <h2>This page will teach everything about the use of our API</h2>
        <h3>The API allows you to query the weather for a given location for the next 10 days (and night).</h3>
        <p>The main part of the url is <i>http://193.191.187.14:11008/WeatherApp-Rest/API/weather/</i> after which you can use {country}-{city}. The country has to be specified by its
            abbreviation like "BE". The city can ge given by its english name in some cases, or in its native language. An example of this would be 
            <a href="http://193.191.187.14:11008/WeatherApp-Rest/API/weather/BE-Leuven">http://193.191.187.14:11008/WeatherApp-Rest/API/weather/BE-Leuven</a></p>
        <p>So in short all URL's are in the form http://193.191.187.14:11008/WeatherApp-Rest/API/weather/{country}-{city}</p>
        <p>Cities that are conformed to be queryable are: BE-Leuven, BE-Gent, BE-Antwerpen, BE-Vilvoorde, BE-Brussels, BE-Liege. Around 200 000 cities are supported</p>
